  <h3><b>Project Statement</b></h3>
  
  <p>  My process started on conception and research into logos and designs. I researched several logos off various planetariums around the world looking for inspiration for my logo. <br> I looked into the Southworth Planetarium here at the University of Southern Maine to see what their main focus and goals were and incorporated them into my work and research. <br> As well as looking for recognizable parts that Maine is known for. After this I started brainstorming concepts of design coming to the idea of a lighthouse or a lobster as the central image. With a planet and rings or some sort of swoosh or flow of movement being added to add in a space theme. After a few revisions I decided the lobster would be a little complicated and the lighthouse wasn't coming out how I wanted it to and did another redesign. I wanted to incorporate the planet and swoosh from the lighthouse and went back to the planetarium and got inspired by the projector inside. I changed the logo to the end part of the projector as I felt it was the most interesting part of the machine and used it as the base of the design. I went through more revisions of rescaling and making it less detailed and more blocky for easy recallability for different sizes and colors to make a recognizable outline. After the design was finalized I made the colors of the logo the USM colors to represent its location and finished it off with a little shading to make it pop from the background to add more visual interest. Overall I think the logo is a very nice balanced basic but detailed design with good coloring and I don't believe it needs much revision to the logo. I do think there's the possibility of the logo not being seen as a planetarium projector and more seen as a satellite but I still think it gets the idea of a space related machine. </p>

   <h3><b>Project Statement</b></h3>
     <p>My process began with brainstorming ideas. For both images I was making a similar theme of a dystopia created from overpollution  and climate change. Taking inspiration from post-apocalyptic franchises such as the Fallout and Half Life series. After deciding on my idea I wanted to use some of my own photographs I took and used them in this project. I ended up only choosing one and used it as the background in the first image. I began browsing the internet for subjects I was looking for to add in. Downloading and shifting through the images I choose the images that fit the image making sure the angels and the lighting of the image matched to the background image. I changed the opacity of images to get a greater depth of scale by making objects seem more in the background of the image. As well I added shadows and highlights where they were needed to blend images together and create a cohesive image making it look like a complete image instead of multiple. I also combined multiple images together to make new details and objects also adding in shading and color grading them after to bring them together. After all the images were in place, I was happy with the placement of everything with the lighting matching and went over everything with color grading and added a little grain to pull everything together and make the final result feel cohesive. The first image is very well done getting the idea of pollution visually represented excellently. With it having a paintery look and feeling very cohesive. The second image isn't as strong as the first. With the lighting and shadows lacking in a few spots but overall getting the message across and still being visually interesting.
