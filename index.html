     <p>My process began with brainstorming ideas. For both images I was making a similar theme of a dystopia created from overpollution  and climate change. Taking inspiration from post-apocalyptic <br> franchises such as the Fallout and Half Life series. After deciding on my idea I wanted to use some of my own photographs I took and used them in this project. I ended up only choosing one <br> and used it as the background in the first image. I began browsing the internet for subjects I was looking for to add in. Downloading and shifting through the images I choose the images that fit <br> the image making sure the angels and the lighting of the image matched to the background image. I changed the opacity of images to get a greater depth of scale by making objects seem more <br> in the background of the image. As well I added shadows and highlights where they were needed to blend images together and create a cohesive image making it look like a complete image instead <br> of multiple. I also combined multiple images together to make new details and objects also adding in shading and color grading them after to bring them together. After all the images were in place, <br> I was happy with the placement of everything with the lighting matching and went over everything with color grading and added a little grain to pull everything together and make the final result feel cohesive. <br> The first image is very well done getting the idea of pollution visually represented excellently. With it having a paintery look and feeling very cohesive. The second image isn't as strong as the first. <br> With the lighting and shadows lacking in a few spots but overall getting the message across and still being visually interesting. </p> <br>
