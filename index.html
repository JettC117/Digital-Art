<p> ((South Worth Planeterium Logo))</p>

  <p>  My process started on conception and research into logos and designs. I researched several logos off various planetariums around the world looking for inspiration for my logo. I looked into the Southworth Planetarium here at the University of Southern Maine to see what their main focus and goals were and incorporated them into my work and research. As well as looking for recognizable parts that Maine is known for. After this I started brainstorming concepts of design coming to the idea of a lighthouse or a lobster as the central image. With a planet and rings or some sort of swoosh or flow of movement being added to add in a space theme. After a few revisions I decided the lobster would be a little complicated and the lighthouse wasn't coming out how I wanted it to and did another redesign. I wanted to incorporate the planet and swoosh from the lighthouse and went back to the planetarium and got inspired by the projector inside. I changed the logo to the end part of the projector as I felt it was the most interesting part of the machine and used it as the base of the design. I went through more revisions of rescaling and making it less detailed and more blocky for easy recallability for different sizes and colors to make a recognizable outline. After the design was finalized I made the colors of the logo the USM colors to represent its location and finished it off with a little shading to make it pop from the background to add more visual interest. Overall I think the logo is a very nice balanced basic but detailed design with good coloring and I don't believe it needs much revision to the logo. I do think there's the possibility of the logo not being seen as a planetarium projector and more seen as a satellite but I still think it gets the idea of a space related machine. </p>

  <p>3D Model of CD</p>
<img src="CD .png" width=400 >
<p>For this project I started with brainstorming an object to create in 3D. I have had a growing interest in the last couple years of physical media collecting cds, dvds and vhs tapes. I wanted to incorporate this interest into my design that I chose. I have a cd player in my car and usually play cds so I thought they would be an interesting object to model. The process in creating the cd started with taking measurements of the object and creating basic geometry in blender to get a good foundation to work off of. I separated the object into four different parts consisting of the top cover, bottom case, middle holding selection and the cd itself. I wanted each of the parts to be the same color and texture as the real thing making the different parts either transparent clear or black plastic and a metallic chrome for the cd. After the geometry was finalized I cut holes in the object using other objects to get the desired shape of the form. Making sure the object was close to the cds form. Adding more shapes to get the desired details such as the hinge and holders. The textures were a little tricky to get right with some research being done to get the transparent plastic looking correct. For the final piece I combined all the parts together to form the final assembly. The piece overall looks quite realistic compared to the real object. Some smaller details on the side of the case and top are missing but the main shape and idea of the cd is recognizable. The final render also needs work with the clear plastic not being too visible and the metallic texture not showing.
